        <p>Ruby is “…an interpreted, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.” 
            Ruby is a popular programming language that enjoys widespread use by developers around the world (Stabile, 2023). Ruby is free of charge, 
            free to use, copy, modify, and distribute. Ruby makes up the basis for the popular Ruby on Rails web application framework used in popular websites such as Twitter, 
            GitHub, and Shopify.</p>

        <h2>Variable Scope Identifiers</h2>
        <p>Ruby uses symbols to identify the current scope and capitalization to identify mutability. 
            Lowercase variables are mutable while variables starting with an uppercase letter are immutable. 
            Here’s a quick run through:</p>
        <li>myVar -> Local variable</li>
        <li>MyVar -> Local constant</li>
        <li>@myVar -> Instance variable</li>
        <li>$myVar -> Global variable</li>
        <li>self.myVar -> Refers to the current object’s version of the given variable or method (similar to Java’s “this” keyword)</li>

        <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        <p>
            class MyCounter <br />
                &emsp;include Enumerable <br />
            end <br />
        </p>
        <p>Like Java, Ruby supports single inheritance where each child "class" can only have one parent. Ruby has specific terminology for determining which is which in the pecking order. 
            Modules are the Ruby equivalent of parent “classes” which offer a collection of methods. Classes in Ruby are the children of their respective parent Module, 
            extending its functionality.</p>

        <h2>Object Structure</h2>
        <p>2.times { print “Prepare for trouble!” }</p>
        <p>In Ruby, everything is an object! Every bit of information and code can be given their own properties and actions. 
            Even numbers and primitive types are handled as objects in Ruby with their own methods and instance variables.</p>

        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p>
            class Numeric <br />
                &emsp;def multiplyBy(x) <br />
                    &emsp;&emsp;self * x <br />
                &emsp;end <br />
            end <br />
            y = 2.multiplyBy(8) <br />
            puts y <br />
            # Output: 16 <br />
        </p>
        <p>Another defining pilar of Ruby is its flexibility. Ruby allows developers to freely alter its parts, and essential parts of Ruby can be removed, redefined, or extended at will.</p>

        <h2>Blocks</h2>
        <p>
            def customBehaviorShowcase <br />
                &emsp;puts “Start of method…” <br />
                &emsp;yield if block_given? # Run any Blocks available <br />
                &emsp;puts “End of method…” <br />
            End <br />
            # Runs the method we just defined with a Block to demonstrate. <br />
            customBehaviorShowcase do <br />
                &emsp;puts “Custom activity woohoo!” <br />
            end <br />
            # Output: <br />
            # 	Start of method… <br />
            # 	Custom activity woohoo! <br />
            # 	End of method… <br />
        </p>
        <p>Like Scheme, Ruby provides support for Closures (persistent scopes that hold onto local variables outside of their scope if a reference to their function is used later on) 
            in the form of Blocks. You can attach a Block to any method to describe how the method should act (Members of the Ruby community, 2025).</p>
